			<p> I graduated from Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara with a Bachelor in <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology" target = "_blank"> Sociology </a> and Education: Applied Psychology. I have worked in nonprofit for over 10 years - working mainly with unserved, at risk youth. My passion was empowering youth, especially females, to see beyond their perceived limits. Regardless of their socio-economic background, family structure, cultural or ethnic background, gender, age or success in traditional modalities, everyone has the potential to do what they want. Recently, I have decided to take the advice that I give to others: follow your passion. </p>

			<p> When I was younger, I enjoyed playing with computers, especially <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhLFsimfhNY" target ="_blank"> DOS’s Aldo’s Adventure!</a>  I also  loved customizing my myspace page! Somewhere between high school and college I lost it - it must have been Facebook *shakes her fist* </p>

			<p> So now I am following a passion I had and I am woring towards becoming a Front End Developer. I am very excited for this new venture and I look forward to discovering this new world.</p>
